## Description of our Web App
Progress Paws is a cat themed web application that allows users to track their habits on a daily basis. The user first start at the on boarding website to either sign in or create an account. 
Then the user is greeted with the home page with a nativation on the top. 
In the My Habits tab, the user can complete the checkmarks of the list of current habits to indicate that they completed the habits. The user is also able to add a new habit or delete a habit on this tab.
The next tab is My Progress. Like the name of the tab, it shows the user's daily and monthly progress through percentage and overall progress through a line graph.
We understand that staying consistent is difficult when following a new habit. We decided to create the Motivation tab to encourage the users to complete all their habits through book recommendations and motivational quotes. We hope that we can fuel their motivation to keep making progress!
